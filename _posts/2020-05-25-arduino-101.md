## What is an Arduino.

An Arduino is a cheap realtime computer.  It's cheap because you can buy one for $4 to $20.  It's realtime because the only code that runs on it is the code your right.  


## What are pins?

Pins are pieces of metal connected to the Arduino.  There are two main kinds of pins, output and input.  Notice the pins are label.  Pins 0 to 13 and pins A0 to A5 are the ones we can control.

## Output Pins

Output pins allow you to control whether a pin has electricity or does not have electricity.  They are used for controlling servos, motors, leds, and much more.

## Input Pins

Input pins allow you to sense whether electricity is passing through a pin.  They are used for motion sensors, humidity sensor, photo sensors and much more.

## Reset Button

The reset button is the big red button in the corner of the Arduino.  It's used to restart the Arduino and will rerun the code that is already on it.

## RX and TX LEDS

When the RX led is lit that means the arduino is recieving a message.  When the TX led is lit that mean the Arduino is sending a message.

## Built in LED

Whenever electricity passes through pin 13 the built in led lights up.

## Cheat Sheet

```c
// Used to tell the Arduino the pin type
pinMode(PIN_NUMBER, OUTPUT_INPUT); 
// Replace "PIN_NUMBER" with the pin number you want to control.  Replace OUTPUT_INPUT with OUTPUT to make in an OUTPUT pin or INPUT to make it an input pin.

// Used to turn on and off electricity for output pins
digitalWrite(PIN_NUMBER, HIGH_LOW);
// Replace "PIN_NUMBER" with the pin number you want to control.  Replace HIGH_LOW with HIGH to turn on electricity or LOW to turn off electricity.

// Used to make the arduino pause for a number of milliseconds
delay(NUMBER_OF_MILLISECONDS);
// Replace NUMBER_OF_MILLISECONDS with the number of milliseconds you want the arduino to pause.  1000 milliseconds = 1 seconds.
```
## Coding Notes

- Setup function only runs once and is always executed before the loop has ran.
- Loop function runs over and over again.
- The code inside the curly braces, "{}" is what is execute.
- void mean that the block of code does not return anything.

```
## Code
```c
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```
